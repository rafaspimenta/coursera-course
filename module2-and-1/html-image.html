        &quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer
        of deeds
        could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by
        dust
        and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no
        effort
        without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the
        great
        devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high
        achievement, and
        who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those
        cold and
        timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&quot;
